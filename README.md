In P2 your goals are as follows:
 - Fix the data model from presentation 1.
 - Add to the presentation 1 data model the necessary entities, fields and relationships that will track the repair process.
 - Complete one of the planning projects for submission (experience map, user stories, or ideation).
 - Create a beginning site map that will allow a visual understanding of your site's structure.
 - Create a menu system that will help guide a user through your site.
 - Create the necessary CRU pages (remember never do D) for the entities in your presentation 1 data model (customers and equipment).
 - Integrate and prove that your team has included the material discussed around accessibility (validation of pages for example).
Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create your site for presentation.

"Next week is supposed to be check in week where I sit down with each team and review your progress so far. We will not have class because of Thanksgiving.
I will create a spot on Blackboard where your team can submit your data model and site (only, I don't need all the other stuff yet) and I will try my best to give you feedback as soon as possible.
Any questions let me know."
